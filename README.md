BitBuddies are handmade, opensource price tickers - perfect for any office or trading setup.  Powered by the [LiveCoinWatch](https://www.livecoinwatch.com/) API, these functional artpieces pull live Bitcoin prices directly from all the top exchanges.  Each BitBuddy features a two-sided Bitcoin logo illuminated by 24 color-changing LEDs.  Download the free mobile app to set the LED colors, brightness, and more.

Choose from 15 brightness settings or run with auto brightness from the built-in light sensor.  Logo LED and display brightnesses can be set indepently or balance-adjusted with auto brightness.

BitBuddies run on an ESP8266 and ATtiny85, and require a 2.4GHz WiFi connection.  Devices can be reprogrammed using any Arduino-compatible software directly with the included USB power cable.
